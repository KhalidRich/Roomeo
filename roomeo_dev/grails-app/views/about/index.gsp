			As college students, we know from personal experience just how painful it can be to search for roommates, 
			and we think it should be faster, easier, and more transparent. So we created Roomeo, 
			a responsive and validated marketplace that helps people just like you find the roommates 
			who meet your criteria. Our matching algorithm ensures you will get along and our resources 
			make the entire experience from sign-up to move-in easier and hassle-free!
